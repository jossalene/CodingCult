ggplot - grammar of graphics - a system for describing and building graphs.

install.package()
library()

Call package to use function in package
package::function()
	- ggplot2::ggplot()

Data frame: a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows)
	- mpg: contains observations collected by the US Environment Protection Agency on 38 models of cars

ggplot() - create a coordinate system that you can add layers too
	- ggplot(data = ----)  - creates an empty graph

geom_point() 
	- adds a layer of points to the plot which creates a scatterplot
	- ggplot2 comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot
	- geom_point(mapping = aes(x = variable, y = variable))

#### ggplot(data = <DATA>) + <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))


EXERCISES
### 1. Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
ggplot2::mpg
ggplot(data = mpg)
```
  It creates an empty graph.
  
### 2. How many rows are in mtcars? How many columns?
```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
length(mtcars)
```
 There're 32 rows and 11 columns.
 
### 3. What does the drv variables describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
```{r}
?mpg
```
drv is the type of drive train, where f = front-wheel drive, r =  rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd

### 4. Make a scatterplot of hwy versus cyl
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl))
```

### 5. What happens if you make a scatter plot of class versus drv? Why is the plot not useful?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = drv))
```
The plot is not usefull because it could not present the relationship between the two variables, thus, it is impossible to make connection for further result discusstion.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
